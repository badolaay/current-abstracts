= Klingon Kotlin in anger with Project Reactor & Spring Boot: Ha' HIja'!

== Motivation

I tweeted this on 2 March 2019:

"One of these days I'll create a session called 'Klingon Kotlin' in which I live-code Kotlin with "great passion" (anger?) while wielding a bat'leth. Or maybe just vim. ðŸ˜„

You heard it here first. Conferences, any taste for this? #ItsAGoodDayToKodeKotlin"

The first response? Our Vice President!

"Iâ€™ll buy you the batâ€™leth if you do this on stage @s1p"

And that was just the beginning. Needless to say, I received numerous positive responses...ergo, this session!

== Abstract

Since Spring Framework 5's GA (General Availability) release in September 2017, Kotlin has enjoyed status _equal to Java_ as a full first-class citizen in the Spring multiverse. The other key innovation/addition to Spring Framework 5 was Project Reactor.

Reactive programming offers developers a way to build message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services. The Reactive Streams initiative provides a baseline and Project Reactor provides a great way to become immediately productive, leveraging reactive capabilities from end to end. Combining Kotlin with Reactor empowers you to spin up powerful, concise, & fully reactive Spring Boot applications quickly and brutally efficiently.

In this talk, the presenter shows you how to:

* fully exploit existing Spring-stack technologies using your weapon of choice - Kotlin - like a true Klingon warrior
* easily transition from uncloaked (blocking) applications to cloaked (reactive) applications & systems...for the Empire!
* define your API in an imperative style *and* functionally using the battle-tested Spring Kotlin routing DSL, reaping all benefits both ways
* leverage powerful new testing mechanisms to make code better and life harder...for your sworn enemies, *bugs*

_The presenter will code all examples live and in real time_. This is not an abstract discussion, come to gain real, practical knowledge *if you dare*. Ha' ghob!
