= Game of Streams: How to Tame & Get the Most from your Messaging Platforms üêâ

== Abstract

Most mission-critical systems have distributed elements or are entirely distributed, resulting in a number of challenges: performance, scalability, reliability, resilience...the eight fallacies of distributed computing are alive and well!

Messaging platforms are often used to solve these problems and increase the "ilities", but they don't come without a few complexities of their own. Come to this session to learn not only how to use open source solutions like Spring Cloud Stream, RabbitMQ, & Apache Kafka to maximize your distributed systems' capabilities while minimizing complexity...but also how to *really* use them! There be dragons when dealing with messaging platforms; the presenter will show you several ways to tame and harness them for maximum fire, maximum altitude.  All examples will be coded *live & in real-time*!
